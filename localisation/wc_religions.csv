mystery_of_the_makers_DESC;The study of the Titans, metallic giants that travel across the cosmos, bringing order to worlds, is widespread within dwarven society. The dwarven practical nature does not lend itself to blind worship of a progenitor race, they rely upon measurements, mathematics, and their own hands work. Rather than taking the measure of their creators on faith, the dwarves have embarked on a colossal investigation of their past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

cult_of_the_candle_DESC;Who would have thought that even such a simple thing as a candle could become a symbol of faith? Kobolds that dwell in underground tunnels and spend their lives mining, primarily for gold, are sure that the candle is wise. And this is not surprising, because in the condition of darkness it is the candle that helps the kobolds to survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
cult_of_strength;Cult of Strength;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
cult_of_strength_DESC;Gnolls are well-known for their tendency to challenge each other over petty matters (such as who is the tallest). Their culture caused the emergence of the Cult of Strength, and the most powerful gnolls are recognized as the greatest authority in this society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

orcish_fel_DESC;The Blood of Mannoroth, the vile fluid that ran through the veins of the Destructor, was used to corrupt the orcish race and bind them to the will of Kil'jaeden. Prior to the opening of the Dark Portal, Mannoroth was summoned to Draenor by Kil'jaeden, who instructed the orc warlock Gul'dan to spill the Destructor's blood into the empty meditation pool of the Temple of Karabor. Some time later, assembled at the Throne of Kil'jaeden, the vast majority of the orcish race - the first being Grom Hellscream and his Warsong clan - drank the burning blood, and became minions of the Burning Legion. Only a selective few, most notably Orgrim Doomhammer and Durotan's Frostwolf clan, refused to drink. After the Horde was defeated and rounded up into internment camps, the orcs began to suffer serious withdrawals and sank into lethargy, or succumbed to demon-crazed madness. Hellscream resisted the maddening bloodlust and paralyzing lethargy that was consuming his race for many years... until the Destructor's blood flowed again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
burning_legion_religion;Legion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
burning_legion_religion_DESC;The Burning Legion is a vast, innumerable army of demons, infernals, and corrupted races who seek to destroy any trace of order in the universe. They have thrice invaded Azeroth and were only beaten back at a terrible cost. Much of Azeroth's history - including the First, Second, and Third War - were due to the Legion's influence. It can be said that the Legion is Azeroth's nemesis, it corrupted the orcs who then invaded Azeroth, created the Lich King, and is the source of most of Azeroth's scars. It should also be noted that Azeroth is the only known planet that they have ever withstood the conquest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

They were one of the prime enemies of the Alliance and Horde in Outland, the other being the Burning Legion. Illidan commanded vast armies throughout Outland, and even a few selected groups on Azeroth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

sethekk_worship;Sethe;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
anzu_worship;Anzu;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
rukhmar_worship_DESC;Rukhmar is an avian sun goddess from Draenor who helped Anzu to slay Sethe. After the raven lord faded into darkness, she created the arakkoa to represent her grace and his cunning. Rukhmar fears and hates the arakkoa outcasts, for they have been cursed by Sethe. Her loyal high arakkoa followers, the adherents of Rukhmar, wage war on the cursed arakkoa in her name. The kaliri are Rukhmar's children as well, and Rukhran is rumored to be her progeny. As the mother of the arakkoa, Rukhmar was their main and traditional deity. Her veneration was eventually abandoned in favour of numerous other deities, such as Anzu, Ka'alu and Sethe, and later an unnamed Old God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
sethekk_worship_DESC;Sethe is a deceased primal god worshiped by, and the namesake of, the Sethekk on Draenor. He is ancient enemies with Anzu and Rukhmar, the other major deities of the arakkoa. Sethe was cold-blooded and scornful. When he flew, the winds bit his flesh. He would sun himself on the mountainsides, but he could never taste warmth. His scales were frosted glass, and his children were the wind serpents. He is the source and namesake of the Curse of Sethe, an affliction that causes any arakkoa who touches the blighted waters of Sethekk Hollow to become broken and flightless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
anzu_worship_DESC;Anzu is a dread raven god deeply tied to the arakkoa and the history of the Spires of Arak. While physically Anzu was meager compared to his counterpart, Rukhmar, he possessed a great intellect. As opposed to Rukhmar loving the sun and sky, Anzu preferred the cool of the shade and the peace of the twilight hours where he could be alone in quiet contemplation. He would converse with the "gods of the abyss", and he would find them dull, witless creatures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

Most races respect the dead however those who worship their ancestors, like Orcs and Taurens, believe that the fallen possess powers that the living can use. Taurens speak to them and can request their help through dreaming and such. Orcs leave more concrete reminders of their ancestors.

forsaken_cult_DESC;This is a group of forsaken considered heretical by most. They believe that dark energy practitioners are just as vital to the survival of life and reality as wielders of the light.

When, instead of his Valarjar, the Dragon Aspects were given the powers of the Titans to safeguard Azeroth after their departure, Helya alongside Odyn raised a section of Ulduar up into the skies to create the Halls of Valor, a new home for his Valarjar warriors. To this day, the strongest Vrykul are hand-picked by Odyn and have their spirits lifted by the Val'kyr to the Halls where they will fight on eternal.; this section is now known as the Halls of Valor. Vrykul, or other warriors who prove their courage and tenacity, hope one day to walk amongst the Valarjar and Val'kyr within Odyn's Halls of Valor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

She would soon create a champion who would bear Odyns Warswords of the Valajar, which Helya stole from Odyn, this champion would slay many for their souls to serve in Helheim. She would also create the Helarjar, a holy order to mock Odyn's Valarjar.

Both species and the Mantid Empire were split off by the Gurubashi and Amani troll tribes, the trio of species soon adapted to their change of environment. This happened long before the Lich King, however. The Lich King would envy the Nerubian way of organisation and the capability to spawn in mass numbers. The Lich King would later attack and swarm the kingdom with the undead. He besieged the Nerubian capital of Azjol-Nerub and, with every Nerubian dead, the undead lord would beat the numbers of the Nerub by using their fallen against them. This would render Azjol-Nerub a tomb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
